# 🎄 Advent of Code: Jacks's Holiday Code-a-thon 🎄

Welcome to my festive coding journey through the Advent of Code! This repository is where I'll be unwrapping my solutions to the daily puzzles provided by the magical elves at [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). Join me as I traverse this snowy landscape of algorithms, data structures, and jolly good coding challenges!

## 🌟 What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an annual December event where programmers of all skill levels are welcomed to solve fun, holiday-themed puzzles. Each day from December 1st to the 25th, a new challenge is unlocked, and participants earn "stars" by solving them - one star per puzzle part. It's a great way to improve your coding skills and get into the holiday spirit!

## 📜 Repository Structure

Inside this winter wonderland, you'll find:

- 🗂️ **Day Folders**: Each day's challenge has its own folder labeled from `Day_01` to `Day_25`, filled with the day's puzzle input and my solution code.
- 📝 **file reader**: A python module for reading in files

## 🚀 How to Run the Solutions

Each solution is a standalone script. Here's how to run them:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [https://github.com/johnhangen/AOC]`
2. Navigate to the day's folder: `cd Day_01`
3. Run the script with Python: `python solution.py`

Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed on your sleigh (computer)!

## 📖 Languages and Tools

In this journey, I'm using:

- 🐍 **Python**: Perfect for quick scripting and handling those pesky strings and lists.
- 🧰 **Various Libraries**: Each day might bring new tools from my coding toolbox.
